# Roadmap / TODO

1. ~~**Blueprint placement resets selection:** After loading a blueprint or entering placement mode (via quick palette or keybind), immediately deactivate `SelectionState` so the placement cursor isn’t blocked by lingering selection gates. Selection tools should still work when you’re merely editing selections or saving them, but they must turn off once a blueprint action begins.~~
2. ~~**Unlock actions during paint/selection/blueprint modes:** Painting, blueprint placement, and selection UIs currently block core actions; add a guard so while those modes are active we temporarily bypass whatever input filter is preventing attacks/placements, letting the player keep interacting with the world even if the overlay is visible.~~
3. ~~**Paint type counter HUD:** Add a small HUD element (top-right, for example) showing the currently selected paint category plus how many tiles are painted in that category or in the loaded blueprint. Update it whenever selections change, a blueprint loads, or the paint category switches.~~
4. **Remove duplicate actions from main UI that live in the quick palette:** Audit both controls so nothing is exposed twice; if a control is available in the quick palette, keep it out of the main Grid UI (or vice versa) to avoid confusion.
5. **Per-layer opacity controls:** Provide opacity sliders/options for bottom/middle/top paint layers so users can tune transparency per layer rather than just a global paint alpha.
6. **Reset-to-defaults buttons:** Add buttons that reset sensible defaults per category (e.g., paint colors, grid colors/options). “Need splanning” to define which sets and what values count as defaults before wiring the buttons.
7. **Paint color scheme defaults:** Define a new default palette that feels more intuitive out of the box; document what the default color scheme is and load it when the user requests a reset so new players have a usable palette without customizing immediately.
8. **Configurable default storage/system:** Separate downloaded defaults (blueprints, paint presets, etc.) from the ones generated during local testing so players get clean, shareable defaults without accidentally uploading test data. Think through naming conventions, storage paths, or metadata flags that distinguish “official defaults” from “playtest artifacts.”
9. **Section-specific help buttons:** Add a help/info button per major UI section that explains controls, hotkeys, and expected behaviors to users who stumble through the menu.
10. **Advanced paint brush shapes & fill modes:** Introduce alternative brush geometries (circle, triangle, etc.) plus “fill”/“outline only” toggles so a size-10 brush can either paint every tile under it or just the perimeter.
11. **World/object selection conversion to paint:** Build a mode that lets players select world tiles/objects (e.g., the Guides’ house) and convert that selection into a paint blueprint. This will likely require knowing the class/category of tiles/objects/items and mapping them into paint types, so treat this as the most complex task and add it last.
