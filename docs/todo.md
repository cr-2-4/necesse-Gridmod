# Roadmap / TODO

1. ~~**Blueprint placement resets selection:** After loading a blueprint or entering placement mode (via quick palette or keybind), immediately deactivate `SelectionState` so the placement cursor isn’t blocked by lingering selection gates. Selection tools should still work when you’re merely editing selections or saving them, but they must turn off once a blueprint action begins.~~
2. ~~**Unlock actions during paint/selection/blueprint modes:** Painting, blueprint placement, and selection UIs currently block core actions; add a guard so while those modes are active we temporarily bypass whatever input filter is preventing attacks/placements, letting the player keep interacting with the world even if the overlay is visible.~~
3. ~~**Paint type counter HUD:** Add a small HUD element (top-right, for example) showing the currently selected paint category plus how many tiles are painted in that category or in the loaded blueprint. Update it whenever selections change, a blueprint loads, or the paint category switches.~~
4. **Remove duplicate actions from main UI that live in the quick palette:** Audit both controls so nothing is exposed twice; if a control is available in the quick palette, keep it out of the main Grid UI (or vice versa) to avoid confusion.
5. **Per-layer opacity controls:** Provide opacity sliders/options for bottom/middle/top paint layers so users can tune transparency per layer rather than just a global paint alpha.
6. **Reset-to-defaults buttons:** Add buttons that reset sensible defaults per category (e.g., paint colors, grid colors/options). “Need splanning” to define which sets and what values count as defaults before wiring the buttons.
7. **Paint color scheme defaults:** Define a new default palette that feels more intuitive out of the box; document what the default color scheme is and load it when the user requests a reset so new players have a usable palette without customizing immediately.
8. ~~**Configurable default storage/system:** Separate downloaded defaults (blueprints, paint presets, etc.) from the ones generated during local testing so players get clean, shareable defaults without accidentally uploading test data. Think through naming conventions, storage paths, or metadata flags that distinguish “official defaults” from “playtest artifacts.”~~
9. **Section-specific help buttons:** Add a help/info button per major UI section that explains controls, hotkeys, and expected behaviors to users who stumble through the menu.
10. **Advanced paint brush shapes & fill modes:** Introduce alternative brush geometries (circle, triangle, etc.) plus “fill”/“outline only” toggles so a size-10 brush can either paint every tile under it or just the perimeter.
11. **World/object selection conversion to paint:** Build a mode that lets players select world tiles/objects (e.g., the Guides’ house) and convert that selection into a paint blueprint. This will likely require knowing the class/category of tiles/objects/items and mapping them into paint types, so treat this as the most complex task and add it last.
12. **Move/drag paint selections:** Let players click on painted tiles (or a selection box) and drag them elsewhere—copying or moving the paint while keeping the selection active. This could build on the existing selection tools but should respect paint boundaries, making it easier to reposition paths or walls without redoing them tile by tile.
13. **Drag-to-fill + outline-only paint tool:** Allow a click-and-drag action that paints/fills the rectangle defined by the drag or draws just the outline if the outline-only modifier is held. This would let you quickly draw roads, fence perimeters, or the shell of a house without manually plotting every tile.
14. **Smart resize helpers (post-release stretch idea):** Give blueprint helpers that keep anchors such as doors or windows fixed to a tile while the surrounding walls/roof stretch around them—so you could grow or shrink a house and maintain the relative door placement without complex math.
15. ~~**Prevent attack/actions while custom overlays are active:** Make sure the player can only walk while paint/selection/blueprint modes are engaged by short-circuiting the attack entry points rather than touching every individual tool; this way the overlay becomes a true “preview only” state.~~
16. ~~**Store paint/settlement data per world:** Scope `paint_state.txt`/`grid_settings.txt` to `mods-data/colox.gridmod/worlds/<worldID>/…` so each save keeps its own overlay data.~~
17. **Blueprint import/export UX:** Add UI buttons to export a user blueprint to a `.gridpaint` file (outside the defaults pack) and to import files dropped into the blueprint directory, so players can trade layouts without touching the filesystem manually.
18. **Default blueprint badge/filters:** Highlight which blueprint is a packaged default vs. a user save inside placement previews and status text, and optionally allow filtering user lists to defaults-only/user-only views.
19. **Additive multi-selection workflow:** Support adding more regions to the current selection (for example via a modifier key or “add to selection” mode) so players can select several disjoint areas and treat them as one selection for saving or transforming.
20. **Move paint cell counter near minimap:** When the minimap is visible, reposition the “Selected/paint cell count” HUD so it sits just under (or beside) the minimap rather than in a fixed corner, keeping it readable without overlapping core UI.
21. **Shared paint channel + sync packets:** Introduce a server-owned `shared` paint layer that persists alongside the solo files and replicates via packets on join/save so every connected player sees the same overlay updates in real time. Decide whether contributions overwrite tiles outright or require “claim” ownership metadata per tile.
22. **Solo/shared visibility toggles & permissions:** Extend the Grid UI and quick palette with controls for “show solo,” “show shared,” “edit shared,” and a permission check (host-only or whitelist). Make it obvious in the HUD which layer you’re editing to prevent players from accidentally painting the wrong scope.
23. **Solo-to-shared migration action:** Provide a flow (button or command) that copies the current solo paint selection/blueprint data into the shared channel, optionally clearing the solo copy once promoted. Include safeguards like previews and undo.
24. **Shared paint maintenance tools:** Add commands/buttons to resync from server, export/import shared layouts, and resolve divergences (e.g., “pull latest shared layer” or “clear shared layer for this world”) so corrupted or stale data can be repaired without deleting everyone’s solo files.
